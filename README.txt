These scripts are multiple approaches at name generation for stories, games, or other creative endeavours. 


NameMatrix
-----------
This python script accepts the input of names (10,000+ is best) and records connections in a large markov model. From there it draws on the built model to produce more names.


NameGen
-------
This approach uses a more english biased approach, with hardcoded consonant/vowel chains to aid in name fluidity.
